# 🖼️ Image Processing API

A **FastAPI**-powered RESTful service designed for efficient image management, processing, and object detection. Ideal for handling image uploads, applying transformations, and detecting objects in images.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🗂️ Image Management**:  
  - Upload, retrieve, list, and delete images  
  - Store and manage images in a scalable way

- **🛠️ Image Processing**:  
  - Apply various image filters (e.g., grayscale, sepia)  
  - Resize, rotate with expanding. 
  - Adjust brightness, contrast, and other image properties

- **🔍 Object Detection**:  
  - Detect objects within images using bounding boxes  
  - Return confidence scores for each detected object

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Image Processing API on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository & Set Up a Virtual Environment

Clone the repository and create a virtual environment for isolating dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Climber1705/image-processing-api.git
cd image-processing-api
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure the Environment

Copy the environment variables template and modify it to match your local setup:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with the appropriate values (e.g., development, debug logging)
```

### 4. Run the API

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Once the server is running, access the interactive API documentation at:
